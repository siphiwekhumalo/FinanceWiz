 Root Cause: Time Alignment + Resolution Mismatch
Your base chart (AAPL) is using 15-minute candles, but your compare data (GOOGL, AMZN):

Might be in different resolutions (1D or 1H),

Might not have data points matching every AAPL timestamp,

Or the comparison data isn’t being resampled/normalized to match the current chart’s timeframe.

✅ How to Fix It (Step-by-Step)
✅ 1. Resample Compare Series to Match Base Timeframe
When user changes to 15M, ensure your compare data is:

Grouped by 15-minute buckets

Aligned to the same exact timestamps as AAPL

📌 If using dummy data, simulate missing periods with null to avoid jagged spikes.

✅ 2. Interpolate or Fill Gaps in Data
If compare symbols have missing timestamps:

Option 1: Fill gaps with the previous value (last known close)

Option 2: Use null to break the line and prevent misleading connections

ts
Copy
Edit
function alignToBaseTimestamps(compareData, baseTimestamps) {
  const aligned = [];

  let i = 0;
  for (const baseTime of baseTimestamps) {
    if (compareData[i]?.time === baseTime) {
      aligned.push(compareData[i]);
      i++;
    } else {
      aligned.push({ time: baseTime, value: null }); // break line
    }
  }

  return aligned;
}
✅ 3. Normalize Start Time (optional for % view)
If you're using % comparison, make sure you:

Capture the start value of each compare series at the same start time as AAPL

Then normalize future points against that value

ts
Copy
Edit
const base = compareData[0].value;
const normalized = compareData.map(d => ({
  time: d.time,
  value: ((d.value - base) / base) * 100
}));
✅ 4. Use the Same Resolution for All Series
If you're using a backend or generator:

ts
Copy
Edit
GET /chart-data?symbol=AAPL&interval=15M
GET /chart-data?symbol=GOOGL&interval=15M
GET /chart-data?symbol=AMZN&interval=15M
🛠 If you're using dummy data, simulate this by slicing arrays or averaging every 15 minutes.

✅ 5. Sync Chart Options for All Series
Make sure when you render a compare series:

ts
Copy
Edit
chart.addLineSeries({ priceScaleId: '', alignLabels: true });
And configure your series alignment like:

ts
Copy
Edit
lineSeries.setData(alignedCompareData); // matched timestamp + interpolated
💡 Bonus Tip: Visual Feedback for Misalignment
Show a visual warning like:

“Compare series may be missing data at this resolution”
and fade out broken lines or use dashed strokes.

✅ Final Fix Checklist
Fix Step	Status
Match timeframes (resample to base)	✅ Critical
Align timestamps with nulls	✅ Prevent jagged lines
Normalize to % if needed	✅ Optional
Avoid different resolutions per series	✅
