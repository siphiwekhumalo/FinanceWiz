 Problem: Why your “Compare” overlay doesn’t look like ChartIQ's?
✅ Your chart (Image 1):
GOOGL line is plotted with jagged drops.

Doesn’t align visually or logically with AAPL candles.

Seems scaled to absolute price (GOOGL price = ~$120s, while AAPL = $170s).

No baseline or relative zero anchor shown.

✅ ChartIQ chart (Image 2):
Overlay (BH) starts from the same visual baseline as the base symbol (AAPL).

It shows relative movement, not absolute prices.

Vertical axis shows percentage change (+3.5%, -5%, etc.)

Y-axis adjusts to fit both plots comparatively — even if underlying values differ.

🧠 What ChartIQ is doing (and you’re not — yet):
1. ✅ Compare mode is “Normalized to % Change”
They show “How did BH move relative to AAPL”, not raw prices.

2. ✅ Both symbols start from 0% on the y-axis
The Y-axis becomes % movement from the starting candle.

3. ✅ Chart overlays use relative scaling
The comparison line is visually aligned to the base, regardless of actual value.

🔧 How You Can Match ChartIQ’s Compare Feature
Here’s exactly how to fix this.

✅ 1. Normalize Compare Series to % Change
For every compare symbol:

ts
Copy
Edit
const baseValue = compareData[0].value;
const normalized = compareData.map(d => ({
  time: d.time,
  value: ((d.value - baseValue) / baseValue) * 100  // percentage
}));
This makes the compare series start from 0% and move up/down in percent — just like ChartIQ.

✅ 2. Change the Compare Y-Axis to % Format
If you're using LightweightCharts, do:

ts
Copy
Edit
chart.addLineSeries({
  priceScaleId: 'overlay',  // separate scale
  priceFormat: {
    type: 'percent',
    precision: 2,
    minMove: 0.01
  },
});
This will:

Show Y-axis as %

Visually align the base and compare from same anchor

💡 You can even merge scales if desired, but it's better to use a separate scale for clarity.

✅ 3. Sync Start Times and Timestamps
Make sure:

Base and compare series start from the same time

All timestamps are aligned per timeframe

If compare data starts late or has missing intervals, you’ll get visual offsets.

✅ 4. Style the Compare Line
Make it visually different (line or area chart), e.g.:

ts
Copy
Edit
chart.addLineSeries({
  color: '#4caf50',
  lineWidth: 2,
  priceScaleId: 'overlay'
});
🧪 Optional Enhancements
Feature	Description
🔁 Toggle between “% Compare” and “Absolute Overlay”	Give users both views
