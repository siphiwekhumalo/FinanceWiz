Drawing tools should feel natural, responsive, intuitive, and flexible.

Your user should be able to:

Click → Draw → Adjust → Delete — in seconds.

Feel like the chart is an extension of their hand.

🧩 CORE UX FLOW FOR DRAWING TOOLS
1. Activate Tool
User clicks on a drawing tool icon (e.g., 📝 Trendline).

Cursor changes to crosshair or pencil icon.

Chart enters draw mode (no panning, zooming).

2. Draw Tool
Click once to start (anchor point 1).

Move mouse to see a preview.

Click again to place anchor point 2.

For zones (rectangles, fibs): start + drag to draw bounding box.

3. Edit Tool
Click and drag endpoints or bounding boxes.

Show handles (circles) on hover.

Snap to candle open/high/low/close (optional, configurable).

4. Context Menu
Right-click or tap-and-hold tool to open:

Delete

Style (color, opacity, thickness)

Lock (disable edit)

Show/hide

5. Exit Draw Mode
Press ESC, or click the "select" tool (default mode).

Allow multiple tools to be active on a chart simultaneously.

🧠 UX Best Practices
Feature	UX Behavior
Undo/Redo	Cmd/Ctrl + Z / Y to undo drawings
Snap to price/time	Option to auto-snap anchors to nearest OHLC
Magnet tool	Toggle to attach lines to candle wicks
Cursor feedback	Crosshair = draw mode, Arrow = default
Hover highlight	Highlight tool when mouse passes over
Delete	Press Delete key or right-click menu
Multi-select	Shift + Click to select multiple tools
Drag-select	Click-drag to select multiple drawings in a box
Draw anywhere	Should work across time axis and price axis boundaries

🎨 UI Design Components
Component	Description
Floating toolbar	Top or side dock with tool icons: ✏️ ➖ 🔺 📐 🔄 ❌
Smart handles	Resize points with hover interaction
Properties panel	Color, thickness, opacity, label text
Layer manager (advanced)	List of all drawings to toggle/edit visibility
Mini context menu	Right-click or 3-dot menu on tools
Crosshair snap lines	Visuals to help anchor tools precisely

🛠️ Technical Implementation Tips
Area	Tool	Description
Drawing Layer	Konva.js or custom Canvas	Use for interactive objects
State Mgmt	Zustand / Redux	Manage active tool, selected shape
Coordinate Map	Time/price ↔ pixel mapping	Map UI points to chart data points
Collision Detection	Mouse position vs object bounds	For hover/edit states
Persistence	LocalStorage / backend	Save tools per layout/user
Undo Stack	Immer or manual stack	Track add/move/delete operations

🔄 Example Drawing State Flow (Zustand)
ts
Copy
Edit
{
  activeTool: "trendline", // or "select", "fib", etc.
  drawings: [
    { id: 'abc', type: 'trendline', p1: {x,y}, p2: {x,y}, style: {...} }
  ],
  isDrawing: true,
  selectedId: 'abc',
  hoveredId: 'def'
}
💡 UX Enhancements
Feature	Description
✨ Hover glow	Light border or glow when tool is hovered
⌨️ Keyboard support	ESC to cancel, Del to remove
🎨 Style presets	Choose default styles for tools
📌 Lock tool	Prevent accidental edits
🧠 Smart labeling	Auto-place text for Fib levels, trendlines, etc.
🕹️ Joystick mode	For drawing on mobile: tap → draw handles appear

📱 Mobile Consideration
UX Challenge	Solution
No hover	Use long-press or tap cycles
Fat finger drawing	Provide zoomed-in “draw window” preview
Smaller toolbar	Use icon-only floating bar with scroll
No right-click	Add 3-dot “...” menu per tool for edit/delete

🎯 Summary
Drawing tools are where users "live" on your chart.
They must:

Be smooth and predictable

Respect user intention

Work on all screen sizes

Support edit/delete/reset quickly
